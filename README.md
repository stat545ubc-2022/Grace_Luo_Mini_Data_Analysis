# Grace_Luo_Mini_Data_Analysis

This repository is for the Deliverables of the Mini Data-Analysis project as part of STAT 545A at UBC. 

* Deliverable 1 can be found in the Milestone 1 folder. This Deliverable focuses on becoming familiar with several datasets, selecting questions to answer with the data, and becoming familiar with manipulating and summarizing data in tibbles using dplyr. 

* Deliverable 2 can be found in the Milestone 2 folder. This Deliverable focuses on understanding what "tidy" data is (and how to create it using tidyr), mainpulating special data types (factors and/or dates and times), fitting a model object to data and extracting a result, and reading and writing data as separate files. 

* The Output folder contains the output files for Milestone 2. 

Appropriate libraries are included at the beginning of each Deliverable and code chunk comments support the workflow of the process.
