This repository is for the Deliverables of the Mini Data-Analysis project as part of STAT 545A at UBC. 

To navigate the respository: 
Deliverable 1 can be found in the Milestone 1 folder, and this Deliverable mainly revolved around selecting four questions to answer with the data and becoming familar with manipulating and summarzing data in tibbles using dplyr. 

Deliverable 2 can be found in the Milestone 2 folder, and this Deliverable mainly revolved around understanding what "tidy" data is, mainpulating special daya types (factors and/or dates and times), fitting a model object to data and extracting a result, and reading and writing data as separate files. 

Appropriate libraries are included at the beginning of each deliverable and code chunk comments support the workflow of the process.
